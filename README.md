# 🛒 E-Commerce Automation Project
Overview

This project automates the complete shopping journey on an e-commerce website using Selenium WebDriver with Python. The script mimics how a real customer would interact with the site — browsing products, adding them to the cart, adjusting quantities, and finally placing an order through the guest checkout process. It’s designed as a demonstration of functional testing, browser automation, and quality assurance practices.

Key Features

🔍 Product Navigation & Selection

Automatically navigates through categories and locates products.

Uses different Selenium locators (XPath, CSS, ID) to interact with elements.

🛒 Cart Management

Adds selected items to the cart.

Updates product quantities before checkout.

📸 Screenshot Logging

Captures screenshots at key steps for verification and debugging.

📅 Date Selection

Handles calendar input for selecting delivery dates or similar fields.

✅ Checkout Automation

Completes the guest checkout flow.

Fills in customer details, billing address, and confirms the order.

Technologies Used

• Python – Programming language

• Selenium WebDriver – Browser automation

• Google Chrome + ChromeDriver – Test environment

How to Use

1. Update the script with the correct product details and test data.

3. Review logs and screenshots generated during execution.

Learnings & Takeaways

• Hands-on experience in designing automated test cases for web apps.

• Improved skills in working with Selenium locators like XPath and CSS Selectors.

• Learned handling of dynamic content, forms, and unexpected behaviors during automation.

Future Enhancements
